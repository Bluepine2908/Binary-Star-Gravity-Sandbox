# Binary-Star-Gravity-Sandbox
I started this project as a basic 2D gravity simulation, inspired by this [Youtube](https://youtu.be/WTLPmUHTPqo?si=G-4t037JenLN4RRD) Tutorial.
<br>
But i ended up having too much fun with it. I extended it into a binary-star system, where two massive bodies orbit each other and how it affects the surrounding planets.

This simulation uses Euler integration and is not the most scienticfically accurate.
<br>
It's meant as a gravity sandbox to experiment with how a two-star system behaves and how planets respond to chaotic gravitational fields.

### Features
- 2D Newtonian gravity simulation
- Binary star system with orbiting suns
- Planetary motion influenced by multiple massive bodies
- Adjustable parsmeters for experimentation
